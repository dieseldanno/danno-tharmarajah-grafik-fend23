# School assignment Figma

This is a school assignment for a course called "Grafikverktyg", translates to graphics tools.
The inspiration for the prototype is from an artists merchandise webshop. I chose it because I liked the colors and design. I've made my own changes to it, just so i could incorporate everything I've learned so far in this course.

# Font

I'm using Rubik for the text, Font Awesome 6 Free and Font Awesome 6 Brands for icons. I'm only using one font style, but different font weigths throughout the website. (semibold, medium, regular and light)

# Icon

I'm using Font Awesome as a font directly in Figma, specifically Font Awesome 6 Free (hamburger-menu, cart, plus, minus, remove) and Font Awesome 6 Brands (facebook instagram, youtube, itunes, spotify, tiktok).

I'm using webP to save up on storage without losing the quality, but I'll have jpg as a fallback solution if a users browser doesn't support webP.

# Logotype

The logo is from https://logoipsum.com/
I chose to download it as an a SVG-file, because it's just a simple logo without any fancy details. A SVG-file is also appropriate as I can resize the logo without worrying about the quality of it.
